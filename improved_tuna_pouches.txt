I don’t recall exactly when it happened, but tuna comes in pouches nowadays. It’s very convenient–eating tuna out of a can is a pain outside of the house, because who carries a can opener with them? Nobody, that’s who. The problem with these pouches is that it is virtually impossible to extract all of the tuna from the pouch! Some is inevitably going to get stuck in the corners, and the limited size of the opening at the top ensures that all but the most fanatical completionist is going to leave tuna stuck to the sides, too. You simply can’t get it all out with a spoon. With no evidence whatsoever, I will emphatically state that at least 15% of the tuna in these pouches goes to waste.

Fortunately, I have come up with a simple solution. Just make three of the four sides of the pouch tear-to-open! Doing so would remove all of the corners that tuna gets stuck in, and allow easy access for a spoon, anywhere in the pouch. In fact, it is so simple, I am a little suspicious as to why this hasn’t been implemented. How convenient, that the way things are now, tuna is wasted and consequently people need to buy more. Frankly, something smells a little fishy.
