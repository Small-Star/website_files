Unexpected Anchor

    Surprise! Lone flower
    Mind-wandering down the trail
    It delights, it goes.

Turkey Tails

    Little fungus fans
    family winters in an
    unfinished cabin

Nothing Special

    Ordinary tree
    Just standing there, like the others
    I see you. Hello!

Daydreams

    A happy thought now,
    a maudlin goodbye later.
    False dreams the mind creates.

Achieveing

    I climb the mountain.
    I do the impossible.
    Both made of ego.

Untitled

    The breath; always here,
    mostly ignored. But sometimes,
    it becomes my friend.

My Old Friends

    Where did you come from?
    Sadness, loneliness, fear, doubt.
    I send love to all.

Untitled

    A burden shifted,
    a weight lifted. So much peace,
    from powerful thoughts.

Hope Springs Eternal

    As I expected
    nothing happened. And yet still,
    disappointment here.

Breath

    A feather? A stone?
    A living creature? A touch?
    Yes to all; a breath.

lesser now

    outline of a thing
    you know you once fully grasped.
    humbling, aching, loss

Mortality

    Baby bird. Just born,
    dead now. Not even any
    feathers. Were you loved?
